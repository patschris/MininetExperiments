## Mininet


## Experiment 1
Presented on the article ["From Theory to Experimental Evaluation: Resource Management in Software-Defined Vehicular Networks"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313872461_From_Theory_to_Experimental_Evaluation_Resource_Management_in_Software-Defined_Vehicular_Networks)


## Experiment 2
Presented on the article ["Mininet-WiFi: A Platform for Hybrid Physical-Virtual Software-Defined Wireless Networking Research"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305782558_Mininet-WiFi_A_Platform_for_Hybrid_Physical-Virtual_Software-Defined_Wireless_Networking_Research)


## Measurements

### Throughput
The rate of successful message delivery over a communication channel (bits per second - bps). 
`Ifconfig` command used for measurement's purposes.

### Packet loss
Packet fail to reach destination while travelling across a computer network. 
Packet loss is either caused by errors in data transmission, typically across wireless networks or network congestion.
`Iperf` command used for measurement's purposes.

### Latency
Any kind of delay that happens in data communication over a network (milliseconds - ms). 
`Ping` command used for measurement's purposes.

### Jitter
The variation in latency as measured in the variability over time of the end-to-end delay across a network. 
Packet jitter is expressed as an average of the deviation from the network mean delay. 
`Iperf` command used for measurement's purposes.
